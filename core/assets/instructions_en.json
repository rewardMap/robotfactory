One robot usually gives you a point if you press LEFT.\n2. One robot usually lets you keep your points if you press LEFT, but sometimes it takes one away.\n3. One robot usually gives you a point if you do NOT press.\n4. One robot usually lets you keep your points if you do NOT press, but sometimes it takes one away.\n\nChoosing the wrong action for a given robot usually leads to the opposite effect.",
    "0.1": "You have to learn from experience how each robot reacts.\nThe robots do not always act predictably when you press the button.\n\nThis means if you press the first robot's button, it will sometimes not give you any points and it will sometimes give you points even if you do NOT press.\n\nBut robots are consistent:\nRobots that take points never give points\nand robots that give points never take points.",
